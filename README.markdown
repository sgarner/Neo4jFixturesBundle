Neo4jFixturesBundle
===================

This bundle integrates the [Neo4j Data Fixtures library](https://github.com/sgarner/neo4j-data-fixtures).
into Symfony so that you can load data fixtures programmatically into the Neo4j OGM.

This bundle is based on the
[Doctrine Fixtures Bundle](http://symfony.com/doc/current/bundles/DoctrineFixturesBundle/index.html).
